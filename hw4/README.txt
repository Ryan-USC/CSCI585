There are 12 terms including 11 features and y-intercept.
With capita crime rate increase 1 unit, MEDV would decrease 0.1084 unit.
With proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft increase 1 unit, MEDV would increase 0.0458 unit.
If the house is close to river, MEDV would increase by 2.7187 times.
With nitric oxides concentration increase 1 unit, MEDV would decrease 17.376 unit.
If the house have one more room, the MEDV would increase by 3.8016 times.
With weighted distances to five Boston employment centres increase 1 unit, MEDV would decrease 1.4927 unit.

We noticed that some features like AGE are not selected, it is because these features have low correlation
with our target variable MEDV.
